## My process

### Built with

Front End:
- HTML markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/forms/overview/) - for styles

Back End:
- Node.js
- Express Server
- Body-Parser
- Mailchimp API


### What I learned

I used this project to practice building a back-end application using Node.js, Express for the server, Body-Parser to parse the form data received on the back-end, and the Mailchimp API to add a new subscriber to my newsletter and receive confirmation or error messages that I can then pass on to the user on the front-end.
